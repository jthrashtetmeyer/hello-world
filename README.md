<h2>My Hello World File</h2>
<p>This is my <b>second</b> repository after I made a repository for a version of <a href="https://github.com/jthrashtetmeyer/PONG" target="_blank">PONG</a> I made using Pygame. I'm a self-taught developer and have learned some Python, Bash, and C++. I would love to contribute to open source projects. I've been a GNU/Linux user since I was a kid tinkering with Mandriva, and I've run Mandriva, Ubuntu, and Debian on my personal systems. My education was in literature and teaching, so I have analytical skills that aren't confined to computers. I love learning, and I believe my greatest strength is my curiosity.</p>
