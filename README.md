<h2>Title</h2>
<p>This is my <b>second</b> repository after I made a repository for a version of <u>PONG</u> I made using Pygame. I'm a self-taught developer and I'm interested in learning Python, C, and C++. I would love to contribute to open source projects. I've been a GNU/Linux user since I was a kid tinkering with Mandriva, and I've run Mandriva, Ubuntu, and Debian on my personal systems. My greatest strength is my intellectual curiosity.</p>
